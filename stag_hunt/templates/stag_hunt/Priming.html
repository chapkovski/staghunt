<p>Imagine that you are having troubles with your teeth.</p>
<p>Your dentist recommends a {{tr_text.0}} treatment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your insurance will only cover 10% of this cost.</p>
<p>You now need to decide the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Pay the full amount in cash. Would this require spending your savings? How would you go about it?
    </li>
    <li>
        Take out a loan, which you can pay back in monthly instalments.
        A typical such loan may require monthly payments of roughly {{tr_text.1}} a month for 12 months,
        which would amount to about {{tr_text.2}} total.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take a chance, forego the treatment, and hope that troubles with your teeth will disappear.
        Of course, this leaves open the possibility of conditions worsening, or even greater expenses in the long run.
    </li>

</ol>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>How would you go about making this decision?</li>
    <li>Would it be an easy or a difficult decision for you to make?</li>
</ul>


<p>We will ask you at a later point to provide short answers to these questions.</p>
